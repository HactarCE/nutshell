### What the heck is a ruel? A rule? What?

So you've likely heard of Conway's Game of Life at some point or other, yes? In case that's a "no", let's define some terms real quick:

- Generation: One discrete step of time, during which a bunch of interactions can happen between different "cells"
- Cell: A discrete point on a regular grid
- Neighbor: Another cell within a given cell's "neighborhood"
- Neighborhood: The set of cells able to influence & interact with a given cell

Conway's Game of Life operates within a "range-1 Moore neighborhood", which is simply the eight cells surrounding a given square on a regular
2D grid.

Life, then, is a *cellular automaton* where a cell "survives" to the next generation if it has either two or three living neighbors,
and where a "dead" (unoccupied) cell is "born" (becomes occupied) if it has precisely three live neighbors. There is a simple notation for this
type of CA devised long ago that simply tells us the amount of neighbors a dead cell requires to be born and the amount of neighbors a live
cell requires to survive; for CGoL, as I'll call it from here on, this notation can express it as "B3/S23". Birth on 3, survival on 2 or 3.

Many other interesting "rules", cellular automata whose cells undergo a definable set of transitions, can be notated in this manner ...
and, tragically, just as many can't. Some rules are nondeterministic and unpredictable, but even without going that far we can find rules that don't
necessarily rely on the total amount of neighbors (irrespective of their positions) but are interesting nonetheless, or rules that require
more than two states (OFF/dead and ON/alive) to function. So what do we do?

Well, occasionally, a concept or rule paradigm becomes popular enough that it gets its own concise notation and people start using it. Such is the
case with "Generations", a cellular-automaton algorithm that behaves like a normal B/S rule except that it requires each "died" cell to remain stationary
and interactionless for a set number of generations before truly dying; its notation flips the B/S conditions and adds a third "C" parameter, said
number of pre-death stationary generations, to the end. (Conway's Game of Life with nine extra death generations, for instance, would be notated as
23/3/10 -- survival on 2 or 3, birth on 3, and 10 additional pre-death states)

Still, even Generations isn't everything. What about all the other deterministic types of rules?  
Well, we can't account for *all* of them, but there has been some very very nice work put into settling for a large quantity of them. Some smart folks
have gotten together (as they tend to) and created a cellular-automata explorer named [Golly](https://golly.sourceforge.net), now
the de-facto tool for exploring these types of CA; more importantly, they've also given it a whole domain-specific language for declaring different
kinds of non-standard CA rules, ones that can't be expressed via the sort of concise notations seen above.

### Ruletables

```py
@RULE Life
Conwayâ€™s Game of Life.
@TABLE
n_states:2
neighborhood:Moore
symmetries:permute

var anyA={0, 1}
var anyB=anyA
var anyC=anyA
var anyD=anyA
var anyE=anyA
var anyF=anyA
var anyG=anyA
var anyH=anyA
var anyI=anyA

anyA,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
anyA,anyB,anyC,anyD,anyE,anyF,anyG,anyH,anyI,0
```

So what's this?! Well, as we can see from that description at the top, this is Conway's Game of Life as a Golly rule-table. We can also see that
there are "segments" to the file denoted by @ and then a label; we'll call these @ segments "headers". The only thing that matters in the `@RULE` segment
is the first word after the header (whether it be on the same line or the next) -- this is the rule's *name*, used to refer to it from within Golly, but
anything after it in this segment is ignored (making it handy for comments or explanations!).

Next, the `@TABLE` segment. It starts off with three sorts of directives: first, the number of cell states in our rule (2, being on/"alive" and off/"dead"), then
the neighborhood (Moore, meaning all eight cells surrounding a given one), and finally symmetries, going into which isn't too important but suffice it to say that
they specify what "supplementary" transitions can be inferred from the ones declared explicitly below.

After these directives come variable declarations; a variable is a container for more than one cell state, but that'll make more sense as soon as
transitions are explained; they're the long comma-delimited segments at the very bottom.

Transitions are declared in the form `center cell, northern cell, northeastern cell, eastern cell, ..., northwestern cell, new center cell`,
or less-verbosely ``C, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, C` ``. For example, the second transition -- `1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1` -- says that the center cell in this
configuration...

```
. o o
. o .
. . .
```

...where `o` represents a live cell ('1') and `.` a dead cell ('0'), will survive to the next generation (i.e. remain a '1' cell). But! Since we specified
`symmetries: permute` in the directives up top, what this actually does is apply the specified transition to *all permutations* of a neighborhood containing two '1' cells
and six '0' cells... so, in effect, this fulfills the `S2` part of CGoL's `B3/S23`.

Survival is actually the default behavior in a ruletable, but specifying it here explicitly serves to override the very next line,
`anyA,anyB,anyC,anyD,anyE,anyF,anyG,anyH,anyI,0`; the `anyX` variables contain states 0 and 1 both, so the line effectively says that *any* cell
with *any* configuration of live/dead neighbors will die (become state `0`) -- **unless** its specific configuration was already covered in an earlier transition.

So that was transitions and variables in a nutshell. But why does the same variable need to be reassigned so many times in a row, as in `anyA`/`anyB`/`anyC`/.../`anyI`?
That is because the format's designers chose to make variables "bound", or more-specifically "name-bound": once a variable name appears once in a transition, it can only
refer to the same value from then on, much like how back-referring to a regex group matches the exact same text rather than applying the group's pattern anew. So if the
rule-writer desires that a single variable appear multiple times in a transition *while* retaining the var's "variability", they must assign its value to multiple
distinct names, using a new var name for each separate desired occurrence.

This format is powerful, clearly, and works well enough for many cases. But it's rather primitive alongside its being powerful, and while this generally can be tolerated
(because not much is needed a lot of the time) there are times when it gets *tedious* to keep track of identical variables while declaring the ever-so-slightly-repetitive
transitions one after another in a complex rule, or so I found.

Enter this whole project.

### Nutshell

I'm not going to go as far in depth as I did above, because the repo's README explains the major changes quite clearly -- but, just for comparison, here's the same
rule as above in "nutshell" form:

```py
@NUTSHELL Life
@TABEL
states: 2
symmetries: permute
neighborhood: Moore

any, 1 * 2, 0, 1
any, 1 * 3, 0, 1
any, any, 0
```


Or even this, if you want to go hard:

```py
@NUTSHELL Life
@TABEL
states: 2
symmetries: permute
neighborhood: Moore

any, 1 * 2, [0: (0, 1)], 0 * 5, 1
any, any, 0
```

A bit easier on the eyes! Note in particular the compression achieved by allowing a single variable name to be used multiple times in a transition (with a different
syntax for "binding" to a previous value), and other things like the `*` shorthand for permutate-symmetry transitions and a "mapping" syntax to complement the new way
of binding.
That may look a bit abstruse, but this repo's main README.md does again contain an in-depth explanation of the additions and their uses -- which will hopefully be
more-understandable or at least -accessible after reading this intro.
