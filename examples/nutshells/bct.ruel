@NUTSHELL bct
An implementation of bitwise cyclic tag.

0: Vacuum.

1: Data-tape 0.
2: Data-tape 1.

3: Program-tape 0.
4: Program-tape 1.

5: Shifter. Moves both itself and the data tape one unit down to render program execution cyclic.

6: Transitory program-tape 0.
7: Transitory program-tape 1.

8: Pre-copying program-tape 0. (Used when a prgm-tape bit is the x in a 1x instruction)
9: Pre-copying program-tape 1. (Ditto)

10: Transitory program-tape 0.
11: Transitory program-tape 1.

12: Rightward-moving data-tape 0.
13: Rightward-moving data-tape 1.

14: Transitory reflector.
15: Ditto but about to turn into normal reflector.

16: To-be-moved-down data-tape 0.
17: To-be-moved-down data-tape 1.
